# ROCKET-X
This is a rocket calculation program. You can assemble stages, multi-staged rockets, do calculations of all your desires, DV, A, Thrust.

This is a project made by me in grade 11 computer studies class. It has realistic calculations for rocketry needs, and an ability to construct
multi-staged rockets using the stage editor, then the rocket editor. It's greatest ability is that it stores all values in text files, so 
that the program will remember what stages, rockets, and calculations you have made in the past.
