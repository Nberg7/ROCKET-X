/*
TODO Long term
-Give sources for more details
-Make rocket creater
-Make rocket viewer
-Add budgeting menu (distance this stage can travel)
-Ability to edit stages

TODO short term
-Make rocket permanenet storage work
-make a rocket viewer
-make rocket showing names number and other stuff work

IDEAS
-For stages, there should be a rocket, and then you can choose premade stages you have made into the rocket, and order them around.
So what this means, is that you can make a stage, put in all the values for that stage, then make as many as you want.
Then you can go to the stage editor and then create a new rocket, and put all of the stages into the rocket in any order you want.
You will need to be able to remove stages, move stages around, delete and create rockets, replace stages, and delete and create new stages
All of this will be stored in files that will be created and destroyed. There will be a file for each rocket, and each stage. 
These will include details needed for the rocket and the stage alike. 

-Expand to a thid part where it calculates orbits, planet tracking, 
launch window, everything to do with spacetravel!

I have no idea how to do this, but elevate the program, to a visual kinda think with like openGL or some other graphics library
